# SOLID
Simple implamentation of each SOLID principle

A module should have only one reason to change

### OCP - Open/Closed Principle
A module should be open for extension but closed for modification

### LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle
Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes

### ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface

### DIP - Dependecy Inversion Principle
Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions
